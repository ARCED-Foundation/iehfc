# iehfc

Welcome to the *iehfc* application!

*iehfc* is an interactive tool that will help you perform high-frequency checks on your data to ensure its quality and eventual accuracy and ease of use.

## Sections

The *iehfc* application works through sequential tabs. First, you will upload the dataset you want to check; then you will select the list of checks you would like to perform; then you will provide required parameters (e.g. variable names) to effectively run each check; and finally, you will be able to see, share, and export the outputs of your checks.

### Upload Data

This is where you will upload your dataset.

### Check Selection and Setup

This is where you will select which checks to run and provide parameters to run them properly.

### Outputs

This is where you will be able to see, share, and export the table and graph outputs of your checks.
